#Flight Duty Time

A python and excel mechanism to track flight and duty times of flying crew.

We store raw data on an excel file containing dates and the corresponding time on duty, 
time off duty, flight time and aircraft registration for that day

We use the data to track flight times, duty times, off days, and rest periods based on regulations and procedures. 

A new excel is created to highlight the tracking and warn if limitations are exceeded.
